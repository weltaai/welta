# Welta

> *Autonomous liquidity for an AI-native world.*

Welta is an AI-native capital execution protocol — purpose-built to route, structure, and deploy liquidity autonomously across chains, infrastructures, and jurisdictions.  
It’s not a wallet. Not a bridge. It’s the execution layer behind frictionless, programmable capital.

## 🧠 Why Welta

DeFi is still fragmented, manual, and blind to jurisdictional context.  
Welta redefines liquidity by embedding intelligence, identity, and infrastructure into every transaction.

- AI-native execution engine  
- Modular capital stack  
- Username-based identity  
- Jurisdiction-aware compliance zones  
- Seamless cross-chain routing

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- You submit a capital intent (e.g. swap, move, stake)
- Welta parses identity & jurisdictional context
- AI agent routes via optimal capital path
- Execution finalizes onchain via smart contract
- You receive results — trustlessly, instantly, invisibly

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Execution Layer — Autonomous AI routing across ecosystems  
- Identity-First UX — No addresses. Just usernames.  
- Compliance-Aware — Reg logic is baked into flow, not bolted on  
- Modular by Design — Plug capital, identity, governance separately  
- Institution-Ready — Transparent, abstracted, auditable
