# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions – Welta

---

## What is Welta?

Welta is an AI-native capital protocol designed to autonomously structure, route, and execute liquidity across chains and jurisdictions.  
It’s not a wallet or an aggregator — it’s the infrastructure beneath programmable capital.

---

## Is this a wallet?

No. Welta is a protocol, not an app.  
It can power wallets, DAOs, custodians, and smart accounts — but it is not a wallet itself.

---

## What makes it “AI-native”?

AI isn’t an enhancement layer — it’s the logic engine.  
Routing, compliance matching, identity validation, and execution decisions are handled autonomously based on trained capital models, not hardcoded flows.

---

## Does Welta have a token?

Not yet.  
Welta is currently focused on infrastructure, audits, and early partner access.

---

## How is Welta different from other DeFi protocols?

- Execution-first, not UI-first  
- Jurisdiction-aware, not blind routing  
- AI-powered decisions, not just rulesets  
- Modular capital layers, not monolithic apps

---

## Who is this for?

- Developers building wallets or treasury logic  
- Protocols looking to integrate cross-chain execution  
- Institutions seeking compliant DeFi infrastructure  
- DAO and capital orchestrators

---

## Will there be a public launch?

Yes.  
Welta is currently in early-access phase. A permissionless beta is expected in Q4 2025.
