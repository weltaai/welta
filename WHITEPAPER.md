# ðŸ§¬ Welta Litepaper

## Overview

Welta is an AI-native capital execution protocol â€” designed to route and structure liquidity in real-time across chains, identity systems, and regulatory zones.

---

## Core Pillars

1. AI-native Execution  
   Capital routing is powered by autonomous agents trained on infra, intent, and cost modeling.

2. Identity as the Key  
   Onchain execution tied to usernames, not keypairs. Human-readable. Frictionless.

3. Jurisdiction-Awareness  
   Regulatory zones baked into execution logic. Rules applied before capital moves.

4. Composable Infrastructure  
   Execution stack is modular â€” identity, routing, compliance, governance can evolve independently.

## Example Use Cases

- Cross-chain execution with 1-click  
- Smart wallets with built-in AI routing  
- Reg-aware DAO treasuries  
- Programmatic liquidity movement for protocols

---

## Why Now?

As DeFi scales globally, infrastructure must evolve:

- From bridges â†’ agents  
- From custody â†’ abstraction  
- From wallets â†’ identities  
- From siloed capital â†’ modular execution  

Welta builds for the AI-native financial era.
